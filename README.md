# To-Do List Application

A simple and intuitive To-Do List application built with **React** and **Vite**. This app allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Tasks are persisted in the browser's `localStorage`, so they remain available even after refreshing the page.

- **Add Tasks**: Add new tasks with a name and description.
- **Edit Tasks**: Update existing tasks.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks with a confirmation prompt.
- **Mark as Completed**: Toggle tasks between completed and active states.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved in `localStorage` and persist between sessions.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool for modern web development.
- **React Icons**: For adding icons to the app.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
